        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>The Maprunner WOC/JWOC database includes results from all WOCs (except B Finals) and JWOCs (except
          Qualification races, and excluding second relay teams).
          Select a menu option to try out the various queries available and see what you find.
          The information in the database has come from a number of sources, but most notably the records maintained by
          Bryan Teahan, Blair Trewin, the IOF,
          event websites, CompassSport and Orienteering World. Flag icons courtesy of <a
