      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>The Maprunner WOC/JWOC database includes results from all WOCs (except B Finals) and JWOCs (except Qualification races, and excluding second relay teams).
        Select a menu option to try out the various queries available and see what you find.
        The information in the database has come from a number of sources, but most notably the records maintained by Bryan Teahan, Blair Trewin, the IOF,
        event websites, and various copies of CompassSport, Orienteering World and other things I happen to have around the house.</p>
