# Maprunner WOC Database

This is a [new interface](https://www.maprunner.co.uk/wocdb) which should be a lot quicker and nicer to look at.

Built with:

- [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) for the front end
- [Fat-Free Framework (F3)](http://fatfreeframework.com/home) for the back end
- [Icondrawer](www.icondrawer.com) for the flag icons.

## https configuration for localhost

Using XAMPP on Windows you might get NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID errors when trying to access https://localhost

In Chrome insert "chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost" in the address bar and then enable this option
