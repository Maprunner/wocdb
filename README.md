# Maprunner WOC Database

This is a [new interface](http://www.maprunner.co.uk/wocdb) which should be a lot quicker and nicer to look at.

Built with:
* [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) for the front end
* [Fat-Free Framework (F3)](http://fatfreeframework.com/home) for the back end
* [Icondrawer](www.icondrawer.com) for the flag icons.
